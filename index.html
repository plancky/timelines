					An Outline of Basic Ideas
	Three centuries ago science was transformed by the dramatic new idea
	that rules based on mathematical equations could be used to describe
	the natural world. My purpose in this book is to initiate another such
	transformation, and to introduce a new kind of science that is based on
	the much more general types of rules that can be embodied in simple
	computer programs.

	It has taken me the better part of twenty years to build the
	intellectual structure that is needed, but I have been amazed by its
	results. For what I have found is that with the new kind of science I
	have developed it suddenly becomes possible to make progress on a
	remarkable range of fundamental issues that have never successfully
	been addressed by any of the existing sciences before.

	If theoretical science is to be possible at all, then at some level
	the systems it studies must follow definite rules. Yet in the past
	throughout the exact sciences it has usually been assumed that these
	rules must be ones based on traditional mathematics. But the crucial
	realization that led me to develop the new kind of science in this book
	is that there is in fact no reason to think that systems like those we see
	in nature should follow only such traditional mathematical rules.
	Earlier in history it might have been difficult to imagine what
	more general types of rules could be like. But today we are surrounded
	simplest rules that are possible.
One might have thought—as at first I certainly did—that if the
rules for a program were simple then this would mean that its behavior
must also be correspondingly simple. For our everyday experience in
building things tends to give us the intuition that creating complexity is
somehow difficult, and requires rules or plans that are themselves
complex. But the pivotal discovery that I made some eighteen years ago is
that in the world of programs such intuition is not even close to correct.
I did what is in a sense one of the most elementary imaginable
computer experiments: I took a sequence of simple programs and then
systematically ran them to see how they behaved. And what I found—
to my great surprise—was that despite the simplicity of their rules, the
behavior of the programs was often far from simple. Indeed, even some
of the very simplest programs that I looked at had behavior that was as
complex as anything I had ever seen.
It took me more than a decade to come to terms with this result,
